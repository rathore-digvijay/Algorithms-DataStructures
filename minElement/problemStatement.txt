A sorted array A[ ] with distinct elements is rotated at some unknown point, the task is to find the minimum element in it.

Expected Time Complexity: O(Log n)

Input:

The first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case consist of two lines. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N, where N is the size of array.
The second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting array elements.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print the minimum element in the array.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 200
1 ≤ N ≤ 500
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 1000

Example:

Input
2

10 20 30 40 50 5 7

Output
